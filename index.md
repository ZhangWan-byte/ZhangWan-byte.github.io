## About Me

My name is Zhang, surname Wan. I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), UK, fortunately supervised by [Dr. Tingting Mu](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/tingting.mu/Site/About_Me.html) and [Prof. Samuel Kaski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uF6H9jMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Previously, I was a master's student studying Artificial Intelligence at the [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore, supervised by [Prof. Chee-Keong Kwoh](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asckkwoh/). I received my B.Sc. from the University of Birmingham, UK, and B.Eng. from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2022. 

## Research Interests

My current interest lies in unveiling the structure of data on top of manifold assumption. Exploring different levels of the structure of data provides a scaled viewpoint on multiple machine learning paradigms, such as multi-modal/-view learning, transfer/few-shot learning, domain adaptation, out-of-distribution, human-in-the-loop etc. Currently, I am committed to achieving a unified perspective on learning from multiple data sources through lens of geometry and topology.

I am also interested in the following topics:
- **Machine Learning:** geometric deep learning, dimensionality reduction, human-in-the-loop, reinforcement learning, etc.
- **AI for Science:** drug discovery, earth science, bioinformatics, etc.

Exploring more than exploiting as an early-stage researcher. Recent trending topics are also interesting to me. Feel free to contact for any discussion!

## News
