## About Me

I am currently a master's student studying Artificial Intelligence at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Kwoh, Chee Keong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asckkwoh/). Previously, I received my B.Sc. from the University of Birmingham, UK, and B.Eng. from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2022. 

## Research Interests

My current academic interests lie in revealing the structure of data at different levels to achieve trustworthiness and learning from multi-source data.

I am also interested in the following topics:
- **Machine Learning:** manifold assumption, geometric deep learning, human model
- **AI for Science:** antibody discovery, drug discovery, earth science
