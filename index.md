## About Me

My name is Zhang, surname Wan. I am currently a master's student studying Artificial Intelligence at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Kwoh, Chee Keong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asckkwoh/). Previously, I received my B.Sc. from the University of Birmingham, UK, and B.Eng. from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2022. 

## Research Interests

My current interest lies in unveiling the structure of data on top of manifold assumption. Exploring different levels of the structure of data provides a scaled viewpoint on multiple machine learning paradigms, such as multi-modal/-view learning, transfer/few-shot learning, domain adaptation, out-of-distribution, human-in-the-loop etc. Currently, I am committed to achieving a unified perspective on learning from multiple data sources through lens of geometry and topology.

I am also interested in the following topics:
- **Machine Learning:** geometric deep learning, human-in-the-loop
- **AI for Science:** antibody discovery, drug discovery, earth science

Exploring more than exploiting as an early-stage researcher. Recent trending topics are also interesting to me. Feel free to contact for any discussion!

## News

- **[Oct. 2023]** Our paper on SARS-CoV-2 neutralization prediction is accepted to IEEE BIBM 2023 (acceptance rate 19.5%). [Link Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GWBEEtS0DANLVAFDPVpuBW3-PshygACT/view?usp=sharing) Final version coming soon.
